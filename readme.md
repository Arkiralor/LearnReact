# Learn React JS

## Notes

1. The following commands helped with `src` not being rendered correctly

    ```shell
    npx create-react-app <app_name>
    ```

2. `if-else` in ReactJS

    This expression

    ```js
    if (condition_01) {
        return statement_01;
    } else {
        return statement_02;
    }
    ```

    is equivalent to the following expression

    ```js
    return condition_01 ? statement_01 : statement_02;
    ```

    This is called short-hand `if-else` and is used extensively to shorten otherwise long code-blocks.
